  description: 
                <ul>
                  <li>Replicated and validated pointer authentication techniques based on ARM 
                  architectures, focusing on securing run-time code-pointer and data-pointer 
                  operations to robustly enhance pointer integrity and prevent attacks.</li>
                  <li>Implemented an optimized hashtable for rapid O(1) symbol retrieval during 
                  dynamic linking in an embedded OS kernel boot process, alongside an ELF file 
                  parser to extract symbol information efficiently.</li>
                </ul>
